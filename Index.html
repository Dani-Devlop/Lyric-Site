                    Her name is Lust She's fooled the mightiest of men Nations
                    crumble from within All it takes is just one sin Lips red as
                    blood She'll take your money and she'll run Oh, her beauty
                    is a gun No, you can't fall in love with Lust
                  </div>

                    [Verse 1: Marino]<br/></span>
                    That's what I called her the night I saw her texting a guy A
                    subtle look in her eyes, told me she Cheated and lied, and
                    it hurt me inside She stabbed my heart with a knife, then
                    told my friends with a sigh
                  </div>
                  <div class="chorus"><span class="titlesLyric" style="text-align: center;">
                    [Chorus: Alexandria] <br/></span>
                    His name is Pride He's never wrong and always right Stares
                    for hours at his might Oh, his darkness lies inside Sharp as
                    a knife Never a doubt inside his mind But his ego makes him
                    blind No, you can't fall in love with Pride
                  </div>
                  <div class="Verse"><span class="titlesLyric" style="text-align: center;">
                    [Verse 2: Alexandria] <br/></span>
                    That's what I had to decide the moment I realized He'd never
                    budge in his mind, saying I Cheated and lied and it hurt me
                    inside And when I started to cry, he yelled at me with
                    despise

                    Your name is Lust (Your name is Pride) You looked at me with
                    sinful eyes You never learned to compromise You only loved
                    me in the night Leave while you can (I wish I ran) Pride is
                    a foolish, broken man Lust will kill you with her demands
                    No, you can't fall in love with (Hahaha)

                    [Outro: Marino, Alexandria, Both]<br/> </span>
                    Lust is poisonous, like ivy on a tree She's a siren leading
                    broken men out to the sea Pride is wildfire devouring every
                    leaf Blind and empty, you can't fall in love with Lust
                    (Pride)
