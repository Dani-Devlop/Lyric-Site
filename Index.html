  <div id="Lyric">
    <div class="chorus">
      [Chorus: Marino]
Her name is Lust
She's fooled the mightiest of men
Nations crumble from within
All it takes is just one sin
Lips red as blood
She'll take your money and she'll run
Oh, her beauty is a gun
No, you can't fall in love with Lust
    </div>
    <div class="Verse">
[Verse 1: Marino]
That's what I called her the night I saw her texting a guy
A subtle look in her eyes, told me she
Cheated and lied, and it hurt me inside
She stabbed my heart with a knife, then told my friends with a sigh
    </div>
  <div class="chorus">
[Chorus: Alexandria]
His name is Pride
He's never wrong and always right
Stares for hours at his might
Oh, his darkness lies inside
Sharp as a knife
Never a doubt inside his mind
But his ego makes him blind
No, you can't fall in love with Pride
</div>
<div class="Verse">
[Verse 2: Alexandria]
That's what I had to decide the moment I realized
He'd never budge in his mind, saying I
Cheated and lied and it hurt me inside
And when I started to cry, he yelled at me with despise
</div>
<dic id="bridge">
[Bridge: Marino, Alexandria, Both]
Your name is Lust (Your name is Pride)
You looked at me with sinful eyes
You never learned to compromise
You only loved me in the night
Leave while you can (I wish I ran)
Pride is a foolish, broken man
Lust will kill you with her demands
No, you can't fall in love with (Hahaha)
</dic>
<div id="outro">
[Outro: Marino, Alexandria, Both]
Lust is poisonous, like ivy on a tree
She's a siren leading broken men out to the sea
Pride is wildfire devouring every leaf
Blind and empty, you can't fall in love with Lust (Pride)
